# CleanSpeech

Use CleanSpeech to remove filler words and buzzwords from your public speaking and presentations.
Users can enter words for the voice recognition to track, such as "like" and "you know," and then give their presentation with the app running. CleanSpeech returns a graph of how many times the user said each of the words. Users can compare their speech times and filler word success over multiple attempts.

CleanSpeech is built with Ruby on Rails.
